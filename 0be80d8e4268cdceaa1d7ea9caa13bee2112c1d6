a file descriptor could represent a plain file, character file, unix domain socket, etc... All of these can have ioctls performed on them.

It feels wrong to use SECLASS_FILE here, since it could also be a SECCLASS_CHR_FILE or SECCLASS_TCP_SOCKET depending on how it's called.

Stephen: are there any functions available which take a file descriptor, and return the SECCLASS appropriate to that file descriptor?
