nits for next time:

I understand that his is an UPSTREAM patch, the following advice is what I give if it is not to make the (edited) path to upstream easier. The advice is pedantic with regards to this patch, but easy enough to comply.

Bug: is not an upstream compliant footer, add it to the bottom so that it can be 'truncated' out. As it stands it has been placed into the 'middle' of the commit.

Change-Id: is missing. Also not an upstream compliant footer and is a reason to reject into upstream with checkpatch.pl. Historically it was required specifically by Gerrit to be at the bottom, but that requirement disappeared about 3 years ago allowing for some flexibility. I continue to make it the _bottom_ footer out of habit...

With a Change-Id in the patch comments, we gain the ability to research it in Gerrit, look back at comments garnered in the CLs during review.
