vfs maintainers will hate having two security hooks right next to each other like this.  If you really want this, then we would either need to enable CONFIG_SECURITY_PATH for SELinux and implement the security_path_truncate() hook, with an additional flag, or re-think open permission.  Eric at one time suggested that open permission should be repurposed or replaced by a new permission that gets checked at the tail of pathname lookup (I think he called it name_resolve or something, but I would just call it lookup), so that one can prevent all pathname-based calls on a file by not allowing lookup permission to it.  But such a permission is only useful/necessary if you have to allow search to the parent directory type; otherwise, search permission suffices to prevent any pathname-based system calls on files within that directory.

What do you suggest? Your CONFIG_SECURITY_PATH idea seems straight forward.
