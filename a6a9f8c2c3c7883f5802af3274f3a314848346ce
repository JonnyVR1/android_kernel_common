Are uapi headers for staging drivers supposed to stay out of include/uapi? When we did the uapi split we created include/uapi/linux/ion.h, and then

    #include <uapi/linux/ion.h>

Colin: Right, for stuff to be merged into staging, it has to be "self contained" so it doesn't affect anything else in the kernel tree outside of staging.

Having the uapi split is still a good practice, just so its easier to migrate properly upstream.
