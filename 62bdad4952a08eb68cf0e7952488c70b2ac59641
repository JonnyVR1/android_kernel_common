a little bit confusing to me, my understanding is that - 
for interrupts owned by secure OS, if they are triggered in non-secure mode, then the trusty irq driver will forward them to the secure OS. 

so, if I'm right as above, then it would be supposed to be -
Trusty requires secure irqs to be forwarded to the secure OS for handling with smc SMC_SC_NOP?
