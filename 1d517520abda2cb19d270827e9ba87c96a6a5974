Here and for many of the other functions, the indentation doesn't look right for the arguments on the second and beyond lines.

I'm not sure what you mean. The coding standard says "Descendants are always substantially shorter than the parent and are placed substantially to the right." As-is this seems to fit both those criterion. Is the preference for three tabs instead of two or something different? I have noticed a lot of mixed tabs and spaces in the existing code (e.g. see Dan's comment on indentation).

I would have expected the start of struct operation_decision *local_od to line up with the start of struct operation_decision *od.  Doesn't have to be exact but it is pretty far off here and elsewhere.  But I'm not a stickler for it; just noting it as other maintainers may complain.

Since requested is no longer used, this function is now identical to the previous function, just with reverse order of arguments.  So drop one and just call it twice with different argument order.  Arguments can just be src and dst rather than local_od vs od.

Wondering we should take this test to the callers since it will be the common case, e.g. if (!op->len || avc_operation_in_range(op, cmd)) ...

Actually, since all of the callers negate avc_operation_in_range, it would be:
if (op->len && !avc_operation_in_range(op, cmd))
Then we'll never call the function at all in the common case.

Documentation/CodingStyle says:
	/*
	 * This is the preferred style for multi-line
	 * comments in the Linux kernel source code.
	 * Please use it consistently.
	 *
	 * Description:  A column of asterisks on the left side,
	 * with beginning and ending almost-blank lines.
	 */

Also, I would typically put this comment within the following { } block above the return statement.

I wuold compute audited first, then clear the bit in it.  No point in clearing it in avd because it is just a stack variable in the caller that will never be used again.

I don't think this is appropriate behavior.  Policy development is commonly done in permissive mode (either global for initial board bringup or per-domain for new services), and if we immediately silence all ioctl denials for a given (ssid, tsid, tclass) after the first one and only log that first cmd, then we'll have a very painful policy development process if we ever want to develop least privilege ioctl policies.  Our only real options are to either never call avc_update_node() if node->ae.od, i.e. audit all the denials even in permissive mode, or actually add/merge the operation_ranges.  The first option carries the potential cost of flooding the system with repeated ioctl denials; the second option carries a cost of the merge logic but only in permissive and only if denied, so not critical path.  Regardless, I would omit the (perms & FILE__IOCTL) test here.

Should have some code up shortly. Considering the return code when there is no space. The Caller does not presently check the return value, but that could change. Some candidates:  
ENOMEM - /* Out of memory */
E2BIG  - /* Argument list too long */
ENOSPC - /* No space left on device */

None of the available options seem great, I'll choose ENOMEM if there is not a preference.

Should we take this inside of avc_decision() since it is repeated by both callers except for clearing the od state?  Is it worth keeping separate?

So that the audited command value matches what was actually checked.  Also so that if we generate policy from denials, we can just directly use that value.

Need to return an error if (key.specified & AVTAB_OP) here since it should never happen in these policy versions and if by some random bit flipping it was set, we'd set data here but try to dereference it as ops later.

Not critical now, but at some point we may want to integrate typebounds support for operations as well.  The typebounds relation can be defined in policy through typebounds statements and establishes a hierarchy among types where child types are limited to a subset of the permissions of the parent type.  So imposing the same kind of restriction for operations would make sense if the type is bounded.
