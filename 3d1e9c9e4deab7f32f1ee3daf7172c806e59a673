optional (not required here in linux coding standards because all vars are initialized and thus _look_ like code)

blank line between vars and code is still preferred for clarity.

use scnprintf (for all) as it returns the number of characters that were _actually_ placed into the buffer. snprintf returns the number of characters that would have been placed into the buffer.

In other words, it acts like:

len += min(snprintf(...,max,...),max);

This will ensure you do not get a pending_wakeup_source + len that is beyond the buffer boundaries, and a max - len that turns into a negative number.
