I didn't see any change to declarations for this in the CL... is the cast needed?

I am specifically casting it to const void * because this comes in as char *. Pedantic correctness, and insurance that the caller does not disturb the psinfo->buf contents. This is part of the cleanup requests for the kernel, when you touch it, you fix it.

In another file, you cast this to a (const void *). Which should it be? void* seems better to me, but what is the type in the write_buf decl?

Good catch. This should be const void *, to remove the __user declaration. I was thinking C++ where one used const_cast and you have to leave the type the same, then you wrap another. C, we can do both in one cast ...

Nit: maybe make this a flag instead of an enum?

from_user is legacy of the design of this feature, used to be a (boolean) int; where non-zero value references that the page came from the user. In the future it may become a problem if more values are added. For example, and this is a stretch, what if one has PSTORE_FROM_VMALLOC which would trigger the bottom end to free the buffer once it is done with it? Rename to buf_id to more closely associate it with buf, and to ensure it has a future.

The compressed boolean (int) is upstream, we maybe should overload it's location and define this a buf_flag with a bit for compressed source? That is a better choice, they placed compressed to just after buf, whereas I put from_user after buffer size.

This solves a shape change issue with the function, the callers that only have compressed will have a zero or one there, the FROM field is zero, we will denote as PSTORE_FROM_KERNEL as expected.

FYI, tried the port to replace bool compressed with int flags, the impact is more than expected as read, write and write_buf are all rewritten. I decided that should be split from this change as a dependency to this one as part of a patch group. It will require that the back-port to 3.10 will require the compressed pstore patch first to make this easy ...

Already commented on the "from_user" name. Good name for boolean, bad name for enum. For upstream, I like "int flags" where COMPRESSED can be OR'd with the buffer source.

"from_user" seems like it would be the right name if this were a boolean...but since it is an enum, something like "buffer_source" would be better (really doesn't make sense that "from_user" = "FROM_KERNEL", does it?

Comment applies to all the "from_user" decls below too.

I am prototyping out a change in this to an int buf_flags as I replace bool compressed with that.

I will show you the buf_flags idea next and see if you like it.
