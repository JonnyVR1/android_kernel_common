Hrm. This makes a lot of sense given that multipath leaks into this file.  For my taste, it'd be ideal if a new helper was exposed that let the targets add the env vars they wanted then sent it.

As is, this seems sane to try upstream and see what they say.  I wouldn't be surprised if they decide that 1 is okay but 2's a crowd and ask for a generalized helper.  If not, then you're golden :)

From the verity perspective, I'm wondering if there's a good way to have this also do kernel notification rather than relying on udev to hear and respond. I'm guessing the worst case is lots of -EIOs, so maybe it's sane to delegate it userland for the error case.  For CrOS, we used a kernel notifier, but it got stripped out of the rewrite that landed upstream.  If this goes upstream, then we'll migrate over to uevent and drop out out of tree handler.
