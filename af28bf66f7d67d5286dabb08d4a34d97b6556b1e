Can we please hold off on this change? I think to fix this correctly, this needs a whole bunch of other changes that need to go with it. For example, we'll have to change how we enforce above hispeed delay, etc.

Junjie and I were just about to upload a bunch of changes we made on our internal tree. We'll upload it tomorrow or day after. So, if we can pick those up instead, I think it would work out better for all of us.
