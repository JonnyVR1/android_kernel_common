Can you describe in more detail the situation in which this is observed?  Both the idle time and wall time values come from get_cpu_idle_time_us() plus (optionally) get_cpu_iowait_time_us().  in order for the bug described above to happen, the idle time plus iowait time deltas between the values returned by 2 calls to these functions must be greater than the wall time deltas returned by the calls?
