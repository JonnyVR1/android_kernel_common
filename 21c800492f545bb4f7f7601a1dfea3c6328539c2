this is calling keepalive which calls spin_lock in atomic context, it needs to be spin_lock_irqsave(), as well as anything else called from both interrupt and process context.  Anything called only from process context needs to be spin_lock_irq() (or spin_lock_irqsave() everywhere).  Otherwise it would be causing lockdep warnings if lockdep were enabled and possibly cause deadlocks.
